This is the main menu, this is the first scene that you come across when you start the game, it is quite straight forward and shows the game being played by itself in the background!

Next up is the level selection, this is shown after the player clicks the play button, some levels are locked until a player beats the previous one, this uses playerprefs so they will always be unlocked for future reference and replayability.
